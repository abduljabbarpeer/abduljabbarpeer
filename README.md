## üë®‚Äçüè´ About Me

I am a Curriculum Engineer focused on bridging the gap between technology and education. My hybrid role involves designing and delivering web development curricula while also working on product development. With a background in Aeronautical Engineering and a passion for teaching, I transitioned to software development and discovered my calling in ed-tech.

In addition to my primary responsibilities, I am a problem solver in ed-tech, addressing both technical and non-technical issues. I offer a unique perspective on product ideation, drawing from my experiences as both a student and instructor. This insight, gained from transitioning from student to full-time employee, aids in designing user-centric products. I also collaborate with marketing for promotions and with B2B teams to address technical and curriculum-related challenges, supporting student placements in our outcome-based ed-tech startup.

Empathy and clear communication enable me to simplify complex topics for diverse audiences. I am dedicated to fostering a community of continuous learners, solving educational challenges through technology, and making learning accessible and meaningful for everyone.
